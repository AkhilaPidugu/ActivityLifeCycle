# ActivityLifeCycle
This app describes the lifecycle of an app
To navigate transitions between stages of the activity lifecycle, the Activity class provides a core set of six callbacks: onCreate() , onStart() , onResume() , onPause() , onStop() , and onDestroy() . 
The system invokes each of these callbacks as an activity enters a new state.
